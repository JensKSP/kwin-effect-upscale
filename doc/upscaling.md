# Upscaling fullscreen windows

What this effect is for, what it deliberately leaves alone, and which questions
about KWin are still open. Statements about KWin were read in the source at
`v6.3.6` (commit `b8de432`, the version Debian Trixie ships as `4:6.3.6-1`) and
at `master` (commit `c1ca390`, 2026-09-13).

## The gap

A game that renders below the resolution of the screen it covers has to be
enlarged by someone. On Windows that someone is the graphics driver: AMD calls
it RSR, NVIDIA calls it NIS, and the compositor is not involved. On Linux
`amdgpu` and Mesa have no equivalent. What is left is:

| Where | What happens |
| --- | --- |
| gamescope | It is a compositor of its own. The game gets a virtual screen of the inner size (`-w/-h`) and the finished image is scaled to the output (`-W/-H`). Current master offers linear, nearest, pixel, FSR 1, NIS and SGSR filters; integer scaling is a separate geometry setting. |
| Proton-GE | `WINE_FULLSCREEN_FSR=1` offers smaller resolutions to the game and scales them with FSR 1. |
| A plain KDE session | Nothing. Steam is an ordinary window, and the image is stretched with whatever filtering the compositor happens to use. |

In a plain session that filtering is bilinear (`GL_LINEAR`, e.g.
`src/opengl/glframebuffer.h`) or the hardware plane doing it (`SRC_W`/`CRTC_W`,
`src/backends/drm/drm_pipeline.cpp:265-274`). Neither KWin 6.3.6 nor master
carries FSR or NIS.

## What this effect does

It takes the other route from gamescope: **the game picks its resolution and
reports it honestly; the compositor decides only how the image is enlarged.**

The effect acts on a window when all of this holds:

- the window is fullscreen on its output, and
- its buffer is smaller than the output area it covers, and
- the effect is enabled and a scaler is configured.

Everything else is left alone. There is no virtual screen, the reported screen
size is never faked, and a window that renders at native size is not touched.

## What it does not do

- **No frame generation.** Frames are scaled, never invented.
- **No temporal upscaling.** FSR 2/3/4, XeSS, DLSS, Arm ASR and SGSR 2 need
  motion vectors from inside the game. A compositor does not have them, and
  faking them would produce artefacts the game cannot correct for.
- **No replacement for in-game upscalers.** A game that ships FSR 2 or DLSS
  should use it; it has data this effect will never see.
- **No resolution spoofing.** Making a game believe the screen is smaller is
  gamescope's design, not this one.

## Scalers

Only spatial scalers can be used, for the reason above. Candidates, with the
licence that decides whether the shader may be carried here at all:

| Scaler | Kind | Licence | Usable |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AMD FSR 1 (EASU + RCAS) | upscale + sharpen | MIT | yes |
| NVIDIA Image Scaling (NIS) | upscale + sharpen | MIT | yes |
| Snapdragon GSR 1 | single pass, Lanczos-like 12-tap + adaptive sharpen | BSD-3-Clause | yes |
| Lanczos, bicubic (libplacebo implementations) | classic | LGPL-2.1-or-later; retain additional source notices | candidates |
| Nearest / integer scaling | pixel replication / geometry | own implementation | yes |
| xBRZ (KWin zoom shader) | pixel-art reconstruction | GPL-2.0-or-later | candidate |
| AMD CAS | sharpen with optional upscale | MIT | candidate |
| MAKO Scaler | single pass | GPL-3.0-or-later | **no** |

MAKO is ruled out as a source of code, not on quality: this project is
`GPL-2.0-or-later`, and taking GPL-3 code would pin it to GPL-3 and rule out a
merge into KWin, whose effects are `GPL-2.0-or-later`. Third-party shaders that
are used keep their own licence headers; see `LICENSES/`.

For reference, KWin master already carries an xBRZ upscaler in the zoom effect
(`src/plugins/zoom/shaders/upscaler.frag`).

Filter choice and image geometry are separate: nearest sampling does not by
itself guarantee an integer scale factor. The implementation, not the name of
the algorithm, determines the licence for copied code.

[CAS's reference header](https://github.com/GPUOpen-Effects/FidelityFX-CAS/blob/9fabcc9a2c45f958aff55ddfda337e74ef894b7f/ffx-cas/ffx_cas.h)
documents linear-light input and a maximum fourfold increase in pixel count
for its scaling path. It is not interchangeable with RCAS, which only sharpens.
[Gamescope's reviewed renderer](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/gamescope/blob/c50ddfa9b71a75ec8df94bda8cf31d425dbdda24/src/rendervulkan.cpp)
runs its modified SGSR filter followed by RCAS; that is a different pipeline
from Qualcomm's single-pass reference. Neither pipeline establishes HDR
correctness or performance for this KWin effect without separate validation.

## HDR and variable refresh rate

HDR and VRR are required, including simultaneous HDR upscaling and VRR.
The effect must preserve KWin's colour management and adaptive presentation
when the client, output and driver support them. SDR content on an HDR output,
HDR content using PQ or scRGB, and transitions between SDR and HDR belong in
the acceptance tests. Intermediate formats and colour conversions must retain
HDR range and sufficient precision.

KWin remains responsible for presentation timing. The effect must not impose
fixed-rate presentation or continuous repainting merely to run the scaler.
VRR must be verified while upscaling is active and direct scanout is blocked.
A configured VRR option or a successful test with the effect disabled does
not establish this. Display-link limitations are recorded separately and
leave the corresponding hardware test pending.

## Initial scope

The first implementation will use **FSR 1: EASU with optional RCAS**, starting
with 1080p and 1440p fullscreen content on a 4K output, supporting SDR, HDR
and VRR. This choice provides
a documented reference and a comparable gamescope path; it is not a measured
quality or performance ranking of the candidates.

The initial path targets opaque RGB surfaces with known colour descriptions,
their full buffer visible, an unrotated output, matching aspect
ratios and enlargement of at most two times per axis. Source and destination
sizes are physical pixels. Unsupported cases use KWin's normal rendering.

The first prerequisites are access to the original buffer in KWin 6.3.6,
a defined HDR colour path for EASU/RCAS and VRR during active composition.
FSR 1 remains the selected starting point, subject to these feasibility
checks. A failure requires revisiting the integration or scaler choice,
without dropping HDR or VRR from the requirements.
EASU must replace the enlargement step, and RCAS must be independently
switchable, initially off. The implementation will start with FP32 fragment
shaders through KWin's OpenGL abstractions, with GLSL ES support checked.
Acceptance requires comparison with ordinary KWin scaling, GPU timing of the
complete rendering path and native tests with a real game on the TV, including
HDR and VRR together. An SDR-only prototype is an intermediate development
step. Falling back to ordinary KWin rendering for HDR does not satisfy HDR
upscaling support.

## Where the effect has to hook into KWin

- **Getting the surface at buffer size.** `EffectWindow::windowItem()`
  (`src/effect/effectwindow.h:672`) leads to `SurfaceItem`, which exposes
  `bufferSize()`, `bufferSourceBox()` and `destinationSize()`
  (`src/scene/surfaceitem.h:29-38`). The usual offscreen route hands the window
  over at target size, which is one scaling step too late.
- **Preventing direct scanout**, or the compositor hands the buffer to the
  display hardware and never calls the effect at all:
  `Effect::blocksDirectScanout()` (`src/effect/effect.h:902`).
- **Wayland clients that scale themselves** through `wp_viewporter`
  (`src/wayland/surface.cpp`, `viewport.sourceGeometry`, `destinationSize`)
  must not be scaled twice.

## Open questions

1. Can an effect in 6.3.6 reach the surface texture at **buffer size**, or does
   the offscreen path always deliver it at target size?
2. How does blocking direct scanout interact with tearing, HDR and adaptive
   sync? Blocking it unconditionally would cost more than the scaling gains.
3. Xwayland games — the Proton default — on 6.3.6, which lacks master's RandR
   resolution emulation (`_XWAYLAND_RANDR_EMU_MONITOR_RECTS`,
   `src/x11window.cpp:3469-3474`): does a 1080p fullscreen window arrive as a
   small buffer with a 4K target size?
4. Does KWin reject a plugin built against a different effect API version
   cleanly? 6.3.6 declares version `0.236` (`src/effect/effect.h:101-104`); the
   place where it is checked at load time has not been found yet.

Question 1 decides whether the effect is possible at all in the supported
version. Question 4 decides how packaging has to deal with KWin updates.

## Versions

| | Version | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Minimum | KWin 6.3.6, effect API `0.236` | what Debian Trixie ships; the supported target |
| Tracked | KWin git master | built in CI to catch API changes early, not a supported target |

Master renames some things the effect will touch, `QRect` becoming KWin's own
`Rect` among them. Where that matters, the difference is absorbed in a thin
compatibility layer rather than in the effect's logic.

## Configuration

Planned, none of it implemented yet: enabling the effect, choosing the scaler,
and a sharpening strength for the scalers that have one. It follows KWin's own
pattern — `upscaleconfig.kcfg` plus a configuration page registered as
`X-KDE-ConfigModule` — so that it appears in System Settings like any other
effect.
