# Slice: FSR 1 upscaling with HDR and VRR

Status: planned; the effect is still an inactive skeleton. This is the single
working document for the slice, covering the plan, progress, findings, tests
and remaining tasks. Update it during implementation. Once the slice is
implemented and all required checks and hardware acceptance are complete,
remove this document and its links. Keep lasting explanations in source
comments; the code, comments and tests then specify the behaviour.

Statements about KWin below were read in the source at
`v6.3.6` (commit `b8de432`, the version Debian Trixie ships as `4:6.3.6-1`) and
at `master` (commit `c1ca390`, 2026-09-13).

## The gap

A game that renders below the resolution of the screen it covers has to be
enlarged by someone. On Windows that someone is the graphics driver: AMD calls
it RSR, NVIDIA calls it NIS, and the compositor is not involved. On Linux
`amdgpu` and Mesa have no equivalent. What is left is:

| Where | What happens |
| --- | --- |
| gamescope | It is a compositor of its own. The game gets a virtual screen of the inner size (`-w/-h`) and the finished image is scaled to the output (`-W/-H`). Current master offers linear, nearest, pixel, FSR 1, NIS and SGSR filters; integer scaling is a separate geometry setting. |
| Proton-GE | `WINE_FULLSCREEN_FSR=1` offers smaller resolutions to the game and scales them with FSR 1. |
| A plain KDE session | Nothing. Steam is an ordinary window, and the image is stretched with whatever filtering the compositor happens to use. |

In a plain session that filtering is bilinear (`GL_LINEAR`, e.g.
`src/opengl/glframebuffer.h`) or the hardware plane doing it (`SRC_W`/`CRTC_W`,
`src/backends/drm/drm_pipeline.cpp:265-274`). Neither KWin 6.3.6 nor master
carries FSR or NIS.

## What this effect does

It takes the other route from gamescope: **the game picks its resolution and
reports it honestly; the compositor decides only how the image is enlarged.**

The effect acts on a window when all of this holds:

- the window is fullscreen on its output, and
- its buffer is smaller than the output area it covers, and
- the effect is enabled and a scaler is configured.

Everything else is left alone. There is no virtual screen, the reported screen
size is never faked, and a window that renders at native size is not touched.

## What it does not do

- **No frame generation.** Frames are scaled, never invented.
- **No temporal upscaling.** FSR 2/3/4, XeSS, DLSS, Arm ASR and SGSR 2 need
  motion vectors from inside the game. A compositor does not have them, and
  faking them would produce artefacts the game cannot correct for.
- **No replacement for in-game upscalers.** A game that ships FSR 2 or DLSS
  should use it; it has data this effect will never see.
- **No resolution spoofing.** Making a game believe the screen is smaller is
  gamescope's design, not this one.

## Scalers

Only spatial scalers can be used, for the reason above. Candidates, with the
licence that decides whether the shader may be carried here at all:

| Scaler | Kind | Licence | Usable |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AMD FSR 1 (EASU + RCAS) | upscale + sharpen | MIT | yes |
| NVIDIA Image Scaling (NIS) | upscale + sharpen | MIT | yes |
| Snapdragon GSR 1 | single pass, Lanczos-like 12-tap + adaptive sharpen | BSD-3-Clause | yes |
| Lanczos, bicubic (libplacebo implementations) | classic | LGPL-2.1-or-later; retain additional source notices | candidates |
| Nearest / integer scaling | pixel replication / geometry | own implementation | yes |
| xBRZ (KWin zoom shader) | pixel-art reconstruction | GPL-2.0-or-later | candidate |
| AMD CAS | sharpen with optional upscale | MIT | candidate |
| MAKO Scaler | single pass | GPL-3.0-or-later | **no** |

MAKO is ruled out as a source of code, not on quality: this project is
`GPL-2.0-or-later`, and taking GPL-3 code would pin it to GPL-3 and rule out a
merge into KWin, whose effects are `GPL-2.0-or-later`. Third-party shaders that
are used keep their own licence headers; see `LICENSES/`.

For reference, KWin master already carries an xBRZ upscaler in the zoom effect
(`src/plugins/zoom/shaders/upscaler.frag`).

Filter choice and image geometry are separate: nearest sampling does not by
itself guarantee an integer scale factor. The implementation, not the name of
the algorithm, determines the licence for copied code.

[CAS's reference header](https://github.com/GPUOpen-Effects/FidelityFX-CAS/blob/9fabcc9a2c45f958aff55ddfda337e74ef894b7f/ffx-cas/ffx_cas.h)
documents linear-light input and a maximum fourfold increase in pixel count
for its scaling path. It is not interchangeable with RCAS, which only sharpens.
[Gamescope's reviewed renderer](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/gamescope/blob/c50ddfa9b71a75ec8df94bda8cf31d425dbdda24/src/rendervulkan.cpp)
runs its modified SGSR filter followed by RCAS; that is a different pipeline
from Qualcomm's single-pass reference. Neither pipeline establishes HDR
correctness or performance for this KWin effect without separate validation.

## HDR and variable refresh rate

HDR and VRR are required, including simultaneous HDR upscaling and VRR.
The effect must preserve KWin's colour management and adaptive presentation
when the client, output and driver support them. SDR content on an HDR output,
HDR content using PQ or scRGB, and transitions between SDR and HDR belong in
the acceptance tests. Intermediate formats and colour conversions must retain
HDR range and sufficient precision.

KWin remains responsible for presentation timing. The effect must not impose
fixed-rate presentation or continuous repainting merely to run the scaler.
VRR must be verified while upscaling is active and direct scanout is blocked.
A configured VRR option or a successful test with the effect disabled does
not establish this. Display-link limitations are recorded separately and
leave the corresponding hardware test pending.

## Initial scope

The first implementation will use **FSR 1: EASU with optional RCAS**, starting
with 1080p and 1440p fullscreen content on a 4K output, supporting SDR, HDR
and VRR. This choice provides a documented reference and a comparable
gamescope path; it is not a measured
quality or performance ranking of the candidates.

The initial path targets opaque RGB surfaces with known colour descriptions,
their full buffer visible, an unrotated output, matching aspect
ratios and enlargement of at most two times per axis. Source and destination
sizes are physical pixels. Unsupported cases use KWin's normal rendering.

The first prerequisites are access to the original buffer in KWin 6.3.6,
a defined HDR colour path for EASU/RCAS and VRR during active composition.
FSR 1 remains the selected starting point, subject to these feasibility
checks. A failure requires revisiting the integration or scaler choice,
without dropping HDR or VRR from the requirements.
EASU must replace the enlargement step, and RCAS must be independently
switchable, initially off. The implementation will start with FP32 fragment
shaders through KWin's OpenGL abstractions, with GLSL ES support checked.
Acceptance requires comparison with ordinary KWin scaling, GPU timing of the
complete rendering path and native tests with a real game on the TV, including
HDR and VRR together. An SDR-only prototype is an intermediate development
step. Falling back to ordinary KWin rendering for HDR does not satisfy HDR
upscaling support.

## Where the effect has to hook into KWin

- **Getting the surface at buffer size.** `EffectWindow::windowItem()`
  (`src/effect/effectwindow.h:672`) leads to `SurfaceItem`, which exposes
  `bufferSize()`, `bufferSourceBox()` and `destinationSize()`
  (`src/scene/surfaceitem.h:29-38`). The usual offscreen route hands the window
  over at target size, which is one scaling step too late.
- **Preventing direct scanout**, or the compositor hands the buffer to the
  display hardware and never calls the effect at all:
  `Effect::blocksDirectScanout()` (`src/effect/effect.h:902`).
- **Wayland clients that scale themselves** through `wp_viewporter`
  (`src/wayland/surface.cpp`, `viewport.sourceGeometry`, `destinationSize`)
  must not be scaled twice.

## Open questions

1. Can an effect in 6.3.6 reach the surface texture at **buffer size**, or does
   the offscreen path always deliver it at target size?
2. How does blocking direct scanout interact with tearing, HDR and adaptive
   sync? Blocking it unconditionally would cost more than the scaling gains.
3. Xwayland games — the Proton default — on 6.3.6, which lacks master's RandR
   resolution emulation (`_XWAYLAND_RANDR_EMU_MONITOR_RECTS`,
   `src/x11window.cpp:3469-3474`): does a 1080p fullscreen window arrive as a
   small buffer with a 4K target size?
4. Does KWin reject a plugin built against a different effect API version
   cleanly? 6.3.6 declares version `0.236` (`src/effect/effect.h:101-104`); the
   place where it is checked at load time has not been found yet.

Question 1 decides whether the effect is possible at all in the supported
version. Question 4 decides how packaging has to deal with KWin updates.

## Versions

| | Version | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Minimum | KWin 6.3.6, effect API `0.236` | what Debian Trixie ships; the supported target |
| Tracked | KWin git master | built in CI to catch API changes early, not a supported target |

Master renames some things the effect will touch, `QRect` becoming KWin's own
`Rect` among them. Where that matters, the difference is absorbed in a thin
compatibility layer rather than in the effect's logic.

## Configuration

Planned, none of it implemented yet: enabling the effect, choosing the scaler,
and a sharpening strength for the scalers that have one. It follows KWin's own
pattern — `upscaleconfig.kcfg` plus a configuration page registered as
`X-KDE-ConfigModule` — so that it appears in System Settings like any other
effect.

For this slice, only the effect switch and independently switchable RCAS with
documented strength are needed. Selecting among several scalers comes later.

## Implementation plan

1. Establish access to the original buffer, its source rectangle and colour
   description in KWin 6.3.6. Use a known pixel pattern to detect accidental
   sampling of an already enlarged image. Check the shader capabilities.
2. Establish the HDR colour path and VRR behaviour during active composition
   before committing to the integration. HDR and VRR are requirements of this
   slice, including their simultaneous use.
3. Confirm that a real Proton/Xwayland game supplies a smaller buffer with a
   4K destination. Keep the session on Wayland. Record an unavailable path as
   a blocker instead of introducing resolution spoofing.
4. Implement EASU through KWin's OpenGL abstractions, initially using FP32
   fragment shader arithmetic. Reuse intermediate textures and avoid CPU
   readback. A controlled SDR path is an intermediate step; complete the HDR
   conversions and choose intermediate formats with sufficient range and
   precision within this slice.
5. Add optional RCAS. Off must bypass sharpening, since AMD's numeric zero
   means maximum sharpening. Keep separate overlays and the cursor out of the
   game scaler. Document colour assumptions and conversion boundaries beside
   the shader code.
6. Handle resizing, output changes, deactivation and resource failures.
   Release redirection and any additional direct-scanout restriction when the
   effect becomes inactive. Preserve KWin's event-driven presentation and VRR;
   do not add a frame timer or continuous repaint loop.
7. Complete the checks and acceptance below. Put lasting invariants and
   explanations in source comments, then remove this document and its links.

FP16 arithmetic, compute shaders, pass fusion and caching scaled results are
later optimisations driven by measurements. The initial geometry is one
eligible fullscreen window on one output, with the full buffer visible and
no buffer transform. Multiple simultaneous candidates fall back to KWin.
Use physical pixel sizes and capability checks, not fixed resolutions or GPU
vendor checks.

## Findings

- The implementation in `src/plugins/upscale/` currently reports itself
  inactive and does not scale anything. Shader integration and runtime
  acceptance remain open.
- Gamescope's reviewed FSR path scales the base layer with EASU and combines
  RCAS with final composition. Separately composited overlays follow the base
  layer; an in-game HUD is already part of the input buffer.
- Gamescope's reviewed SGSR path uses a modified filter followed by RCAS. It
  cannot be treated as Qualcomm's single-pass reference when comparing costs.
- In the reviewed gamescope code, `update_tmp_images()` allocates an 8-bit
  intermediate image, and the NIS wrapper leaves its HDR modes at their SDR
  defaults. These are not a ready-made HDR integration for KWin.
- FSR's input range and transfer-function assumptions require an explicit HDR
  conversion design. Raw scRGB must not simply be clamped into an SDR buffer.
  Using FP32 shader arithmetic does not by itself solve intermediate-format
  precision or colour management.
- FSR documents a useful range up to four times the input pixel count. The
  1080p/1440p to 4K cases fit that range; 720p to 4K is outside this slice.
- NIS has explicit linear-HDR and PQ modes and remains an alternative if the
  FSR integration cannot meet the required HDR behaviour. HDR and VRR remain
  requirements if the scaler choice changes.

These are source-review findings, not measured quality, timing or power
results for this effect. The reviewed gamescope commit is linked above;
[AMD's reference](https://github.com/GPUOpen-Effects/FidelityFX-FSR) and
[NVIDIA's reference](https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/NVIDIAImageScaling)
document the algorithm inputs. Other sources remain listed in the README.

## Validation and acceptance

Record each actual run here with its environment, result and any remaining
limitation. The following are required checks, not claims of success:

| Area | Required evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Repository checks | `pre-commit run --all-files` in the container; inspect the output. |
| Builds | Trixie and neon unstable, GCC and Clang, warnings as errors; GLSL and GLSL ES shader validation. |
| Runtime | Tests against KWin's virtual backend in the container; actual original-buffer sizes and pixel mapping. |
| Real game | Native build on the TV, with a smaller game buffer and 4K destination; 1080p and 1440p patterns, plus the resolutions offered by the game. |
| Image quality | Compare KWin scaling, EASU, and EASU plus RCAS on identical input; inspect text, HUD, fine edges and camera movement with Jens. |
| HDR | SDR to SDR, SDR to HDR, PQ and scRGB to HDR, and transitions; gradients, highlights, wide-gamut colours and negative scRGB values without accidental clipping or duplicate colour conversion. |
| VRR | Verify adaptive presentation with active scaling and blocked direct scanout, both in SDR and HDR, across changing frame rates within the actual output range. An enabled setting alone is insufficient. |
| Cost | Measure total GPU rendering time, frame times and power at comparable frame rates, including the loss of direct scanout. Fixed 60 Hz is one baseline; test 120 Hz where the output path supports it. |
| Lifecycle | Native resolution, windowed mode, unsupported geometry, resource failure, output changes and deactivation preserve normal rendering, cursor and overlays; no stale textures or persistent scanout restriction. |

A driver or display-link limitation leaves the corresponding hardware test
open. It does not remove HDR or VRR from the scope. Falling back for every
HDR input is not HDR upscaling support, and virtual tests do not replace
real-display acceptance.

No scaler implementation has yet been built, timed or accepted on the TV.
Documentation checks do not constitute completion of the slice.
