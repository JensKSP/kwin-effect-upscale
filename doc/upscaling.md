# Upscaling developer handbook

This is the permanent developer handbook for the effect: requirements,
specification, design rationale and KWin integration constraints. Keep it in
sync with the implementation and distinguish intended behaviour from features
that already work. The effect is currently an inactive skeleton.

Each major implementation slice has its own temporary document for its plan,
progress, findings, TODOs and test results. The current slice is
[FSR 1 with HDR and VRR](slice-fsr1-hdr-vrr.md). Completing a slice removes only
its working document; this handbook remains. Durable implementation details
also belong in source comments and tests.

Statements about KWin below were read in the source at
`v6.3.6` (commit `b8de432`, the version Debian Trixie ships as `4:6.3.6-1`) and
at `master` (commit `c1ca390`, 2026-09-13).

## The gap

A game that renders below the resolution of the screen it covers has to be
enlarged by someone. On Windows that someone is the graphics driver: AMD calls
it RSR, NVIDIA calls it NIS, and the compositor is not involved. On Linux
`amdgpu` and Mesa have no equivalent. What is left is:

| Where | What happens |
| --- | --- |
| gamescope | It is a compositor of its own. The game gets a virtual screen of the inner size (`-w/-h`) and the finished image is scaled to the output (`-W/-H`). Current master offers linear, nearest, pixel, FSR 1, NIS and SGSR filters; integer scaling is a separate geometry setting. |
| Proton-GE | `WINE_FULLSCREEN_FSR=1` offers smaller resolutions to the game and scales them with FSR 1. |
| A plain KDE session | Nothing. Steam is an ordinary window, and the image is stretched with whatever filtering the compositor happens to use. |

In a plain session that filtering is bilinear (`GL_LINEAR`, e.g.
`src/opengl/glframebuffer.h`) or the hardware plane doing it (`SRC_W`/`CRTC_W`,
`src/backends/drm/drm_pipeline.cpp:265-274`). Neither KWin 6.3.6 nor master
carries FSR or NIS.

## What this effect does

It takes the other route from gamescope: **the game picks its resolution and
reports it honestly; the compositor decides only how the image is enlarged.**

The effect acts on a window when all of this holds:

- the window is fullscreen on its output, and
- its buffer is smaller than the output area it covers, and
- the effect is enabled and a scaler is configured.

Everything else is left alone. There is no virtual screen, the reported screen
size is never faked, and a window that renders at native size is not touched.

## What it does not do

- **No frame generation.** Frames are scaled, never invented.
- **No temporal upscaling.** FSR 2/3/4, XeSS, DLSS, Arm ASR and SGSR 2 need
  motion vectors from inside the game. A compositor does not have them, and
  faking them would produce artefacts the game cannot correct for.
- **No replacement for in-game upscalers.** A game that ships FSR 2 or DLSS
  should use it; it has data this effect will never see.
- **No resolution spoofing.** Making a game believe the screen is smaller is
  gamescope's design, not this one.

## Scalers

Only spatial scalers can be used, for the reason above. Candidates, with the
licence that decides whether the shader may be carried here at all:

| Scaler | Kind | Licence | Usable |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AMD FSR 1 (EASU + RCAS) | upscale + sharpen | MIT | yes |
| NVIDIA Image Scaling (NIS) | upscale + sharpen | MIT | yes |
| Snapdragon GSR 1 | single pass, Lanczos-like 12-tap + adaptive sharpen | BSD-3-Clause | yes |
| Lanczos, bicubic (libplacebo implementations) | classic | LGPL-2.1-or-later; retain additional source notices | candidates |
| Nearest / integer scaling | pixel replication / geometry | own implementation | yes |
| xBRZ (KWin zoom shader) | pixel-art reconstruction | GPL-2.0-or-later | candidate |
| AMD CAS | sharpen with optional upscale | MIT | candidate |
| MAKO Scaler | single pass | GPL-3.0-or-later | **no** |

MAKO is ruled out as a source of code, not on quality: this project is
`GPL-2.0-or-later`, and taking GPL-3 code would pin it to GPL-3 and rule out a
merge into KWin, whose effects are `GPL-2.0-or-later`. Third-party shaders that
are used keep their own licence headers; see `LICENSES/`.

For reference, KWin master already carries an xBRZ upscaler in the zoom effect
(`src/plugins/zoom/shaders/upscaler.frag`).

Filter choice and image geometry are separate: nearest sampling does not by
itself guarantee an integer scale factor. The implementation, not the name of
the algorithm, determines the licence for copied code.

[CAS's reference header](https://github.com/GPUOpen-Effects/FidelityFX-CAS/blob/9fabcc9a2c45f958aff55ddfda337e74ef894b7f/ffx-cas/ffx_cas.h)
documents linear-light input and a maximum fourfold increase in pixel count
for its scaling path. It is not interchangeable with RCAS, which only sharpens.
[Gamescope's reviewed renderer](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/gamescope/blob/c50ddfa9b71a75ec8df94bda8cf31d425dbdda24/src/rendervulkan.cpp)
runs its modified SGSR filter followed by RCAS; that is a different pipeline
from Qualcomm's single-pass reference. Neither pipeline establishes HDR
correctness or performance for this KWin effect without separate validation.

## HDR and variable refresh rate

HDR and VRR are required, including simultaneous HDR upscaling and VRR.
The effect must preserve KWin's colour management and adaptive presentation
when the client, output and driver support them. SDR content on an HDR output,
HDR content using PQ or scRGB, and transitions between SDR and HDR belong in
the acceptance tests. Intermediate formats and colour conversions must retain
HDR range and sufficient precision.

KWin remains responsible for presentation timing. The effect must not impose
fixed-rate presentation or continuous repainting merely to run the scaler.
VRR must be verified while upscaling is active and direct scanout is blocked.
A configured VRR option or a successful test with the effect disabled does
not establish this. Display-link limitations are recorded separately and
leave the corresponding hardware test pending.

## Selected initial approach

The first implementation will use **FSR 1: EASU with optional RCAS**, starting
with 1080p and 1440p fullscreen content on a 4K output, supporting SDR, HDR
and VRR. This choice provides a documented reference and a comparable
gamescope path; it is not a measured quality or performance ranking of the
candidates.

The initial path targets opaque RGB surfaces with known colour descriptions,
their full buffer visible, an unrotated output, matching aspect
ratios and enlargement of at most two times per axis. Source and destination
sizes are physical pixels. Unsupported cases use KWin's normal rendering.

The first prerequisites are access to the original buffer in KWin 6.3.6,
a defined HDR colour path for EASU/RCAS and VRR during active composition.
FSR 1 remains the selected starting point, subject to these feasibility
checks. A failure requires revisiting the integration or scaler choice,
without dropping HDR or VRR from the requirements.
EASU must replace the enlargement step, and RCAS must be independently
switchable, initially off. The implementation will start with FP32 fragment
shaders through KWin's OpenGL abstractions, with GLSL ES support checked.
Acceptance requires comparison with ordinary KWin scaling, GPU timing of the
complete rendering path and native tests with a real game on the TV, including
HDR and VRR together. An SDR-only prototype is an intermediate development
step. Falling back to ordinary KWin rendering for HDR does not satisfy HDR
upscaling support.

## Where the effect has to hook into KWin

- **Getting the surface at buffer size.** `EffectWindow::windowItem()`
  (`src/effect/effectwindow.h:672`) leads to `SurfaceItem`, which exposes
  `bufferSize()`, `bufferSourceBox()` and `destinationSize()`
  (`src/scene/surfaceitem.h:29-38`). The usual offscreen route hands the window
  over at target size, which is one scaling step too late.
- **Preventing direct scanout**, or the compositor hands the buffer to the
  display hardware and never calls the effect at all:
  `Effect::blocksDirectScanout()` (`src/effect/effect.h:902`).
- **Wayland clients that scale themselves** through `wp_viewporter`
  (`src/wayland/surface.cpp`, `viewport.sourceGeometry`, `destinationSize`)
  must not be scaled twice.

## Versions

| | Version | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Minimum | KWin 6.3.6, effect API `0.236` | what Debian Trixie ships; the supported target |
| Tracked | KWin git master | built in CI to catch API changes early, not a supported target |

Master renames some things the effect will touch, `QRect` becoming KWin's own
`Rect` among them. Where that matters, the difference is absorbed in a thin
compatibility layer rather than in the effect's logic.

## Configuration

Planned, none of it implemented yet. Configuration follows KWin's own pattern:
`upscaleconfig.kcfg` and a page registered as `X-KDE-ConfigModule` in System
Settings. The initial slice includes these controls and status information:

| Control | Behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| Enable upscaling | Enable processing of eligible fullscreen windows; disabling restores normal KWin rendering. |
| Scaler | Show FSR 1 for the initial implementation. Offer a selector when several scalers are implemented and supported. |
| Preferred game resolution | Automatic (use the supplied buffer), or a percentage slider with a numeric percentage and live width by height in physical pixels. |
| Resolution preset | Native, Ultra Quality, Quality, Balanced, Performance, or Custom; changing the slider selects Custom. |
| Sharpening | RCAS switch, initially off, and a 0–100% strength slider. Zero bypasses sharpening; increasing the value increases strength. The UI must not expose AMD's reversed parameter directly. |
| Status | Desired input, actual supplied input, destination resolution, active scaler, and a reason when upscaling is inactive. Show HDR and VRR information only to the extent actually known. |

HDR and VRR follow KWin's display settings. They are mandatory supported paths,
not optional quality presets. An enabled VRR setting must not be labelled as
proof of currently variable presentation.

### Percentage and pixel resolution

The slider expresses the desired input size as a percentage of the covered
output's physical pixel width and height, independently of Plasma's desktop
scale. It ranges from 50% to 100% for the initial FSR path, with one-percentage-
point steps for custom values and keyboard operation. Both dimensions use the
same factor; there are no independent width and height sliders. Show the
rounded integer pixel dimensions beside the percentage before applying it.
At 50%, each dimension is halved: the pixel count is one quarter, not one half.

Presets retain the exact scale ratio rather than deriving dimensions from the
rounded percentage label. The familiar FSR names and ratios follow
[AMD's FSR 1 quality modes](https://gpuopen.com/fidelityfx-superresolution/#amd-fidelityfx-super-resolution-quality-modes).
They select a desired input size, not different EASU shader implementations:

| Preset | Input size per dimension | Example input for 3840 × 2160 output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Native | 100% | 3840 × 2160 |
| Ultra Quality | 1 / 1.3, approximately 76.9% | 2954 × 1662 |
| Quality | 1 / 1.5, approximately 66.7% | 2560 × 1440 |
| Balanced | 1 / 1.7, approximately 58.8% | 2259 × 1271 |
| Performance | 1 / 2, 50% | 1920 × 1080 |
| Custom | User-selected percentage; for example 75% | 2880 × 1620 at 75% |

These examples round each dimension to the nearest integer, with halves
rounded up. Allow the resulting subpixel aspect-ratio rounding discrepancy
when checking geometry; larger mismatches remain unsupported. A client's
supported modes or scale granularity may differ. Display any negotiated size
as such, separately from the calculated wish and the actual committed buffer.
The example dimensions are calculated targets, not guaranteed game modes.

Automatic is the default and makes no resolution request. Selecting Native
requests or recommends native input; processing still follows the actual
buffer until the client changes it. At actual native resolution the initial
effect bypasses both EASU and RCAS. Turning the effect off is a separate action.
On an output change, recompute the desired pixels from the stored percentage
or preset; never change the monitor mode or desktop scale to satisfy the wish.

### What a resolution wish can control

The preferred resolution is a best-effort target. Whenever a supported control
path is available, attempt to reach it. The actual committed buffer always
determines scaler input and eligibility. A game with a fixed resolution is
scaled from that resolution if it is otherwise eligible, even when it differs
from the wish. A mismatch alone must not disable upscaling. Geometry outside
the supported range still uses KWin's normal rendering.

The effect receives a finished image. A game's internal 3D render resolution
can differ from the submitted buffer size, for example when an in-game
upscaler already produces a native-size image. Label the observed value as
**supplied input resolution**, not as a measurement of internal rendering.
Shrinking a completed native-size image and enlarging it again cannot save
the game's rendering work and must not implement this slider.

| Route | What is possible | Project decision |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Game's own settings | The game selects a smaller output buffer or its own internal render scale. An internal scale alone need not produce a smaller submitted buffer. | Always offer the calculated desired pixel size as guidance; verify what buffer actually arrives. |
| Cooperative native Wayland client | A compositor can suggest a preferred surface scale. The client must support and act on that hint. | Investigate for this slice; enable requests only after the supported KWin integration and client behaviour are verified. |
| Proton/Xwayland game | Resolution selection and delivery depend on the game and Xwayland integration. The Wayland hint is not a generic control for Windows game render settings. | Verify separately on a real game; otherwise show that the resolution must be selected in the game. |
| Virtual output or nested compositor | A separate environment can advertise chosen screen modes, as gamescope does. | Outside the current design, which does not spoof output modes or run another compositor. |

The [Wayland fractional-scale protocol](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland-protocols/-/blob/main/staging/fractional-scale/fractional-scale-v1.xml)
defines a preferred scale relative to surface-local dimensions, in units of
1/120. It is a suggestion, not an acknowledgement of a changed buffer or an
API for the game's internal render resolution.
[KWin 6.3.6's SurfaceInterface](https://invent.kde.org/plasma/kwin/-/blob/v6.3.6/src/wayland/surface.h)
exposes `setPreferredBufferScale()`. That is an integration lead, not evidence
that an effect can safely override KWin's scale policy. Any implementation must
account for logical versus physical sizes, protocol quantisation, output
changes and restoration of KWin's normal scale preference.
[Gamescope's README](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/gamescope#gamescope-the-micro-compositor-formerly-known-as-steamcompmgr)
describes its separate virtual-screen approach.

The desired percentage remains usable as a clearly labelled recommendation
when no verified request mechanism is available. Explain briefly: "Select
2560 × 1440 in the game", for example. If a supported request is sent, show it
as pending until a committed buffer confirms the result. Never label a saved
preference as applied merely because the configuration was accepted. If the
client ignores or adjusts it, show the actual dimensions and continue scaling
eligible buffers at their actual size. Do not repeatedly resend an ignored
request or repaint continuously while waiting. Apply a request on slider
release or explicit Apply, rather than at every drag position.

## Rendering and lifecycle requirements

EASU replaces the enlargement step and must receive the original buffer, not
an image already scaled to the destination. The initial geometry permits one
eligible fullscreen window on one output, with the full buffer visible and
no buffer transform. Multiple simultaneous candidates use normal KWin
rendering. Eligibility uses physical pixel sizes and capabilities rather than
fixed resolutions or GPU vendor checks.

RCAS is initially off and must have a real bypass: AMD's numeric zero means
maximum sharpening. Separately composited overlays and the cursor retain
KWin's normal rendering; an in-game HUD is already part of the game buffer.
Intermediate textures are reused without CPU readback. FP32 arithmetic alone
does not establish HDR correctness; formats and colour conversions must
preserve range and precision as well.

Resizing, output changes, deactivation and resource failures must preserve
normal rendering without stale textures. Release redirection and additional
direct-scanout restrictions when the effect becomes inactive. KWin owns
presentation timing; no frame timer or continuous repaint loop is introduced.

## Validation requirements

Validate original-buffer pixel mapping and lifecycle behaviour against KWin's
virtual backend, and image quality, HDR and VRR on the real output with a real
game. Compare ordinary KWin scaling, EASU, and EASU with RCAS using identical
input. Measure the whole rendering path, including the cost of losing direct
scanout, rather than timing the shader alone.

Record actual results and outstanding checks in the corresponding slice
document. An SDR prototype, a documentation check or a configured VRR setting
does not establish completion of the required HDR and VRR support.
